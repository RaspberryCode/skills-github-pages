👋 Hello, Fellow Tech Enthusiast!
Welcome to the Software Kitchen! Let's simmer in the world of programming, brew tech insights, and fry challenges together.

🤖 About Me:
With over {{years_of_experience}}⃣ years of experience under my belt, I've been kneading and molding the dough of the tech world to perfection. A proud alumnus of Cracow University of Technology, I hold an engineering degree in Computer Science and a master's in Cybersecurity. While my heart beats in Java rhythm, I've always been mesmerized by the charm of crafting user-friendly UIs using React. And yes, serving client-ready solutions with Kubernetes is my forte!

🔧 Technologies I love to cook:

🍵 Java: The robust core of many enterprise solutions.

⚛️ React: Breathing life into interactive user interfaces.

⚓ Kubernetes: Orchestrating containers for client-ready deployments.
